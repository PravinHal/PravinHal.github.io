<h2>Books</h2>

<a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111?sa-no-redirect=1">Superintelligence</a> by Nick Bostrom.
Why Artificial Intelligence that reaches human level capabilities will be so dangerous and very difficult to control. It won't be a Terminator like situation but one where we say
"make humans happy" or "solve this hard math problem" and in doing so inadvertently wipes out humanity. How do we embed human values into computer code and can we even come up with a
cohesive set of human values?
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Symbolic-Species-Co-evolution-Language-Brain/dp/0393317544?sa-no-redirect=1">Symbolic Species</a> by Terrence Deacon. The potential origins of human language, a compelling taxonomy for language, why humans are so smart/unique.
This work is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03406.pdf">now being used</a> to motivate high level thinking about the future direction of AI research.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating/dp/0691166854?sa-no-redirect=1"> The Secret of Our Success </a> by Joseph Henrich. Read <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/">this</a> for a great book review. I write about some lessons learnt from this book in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/On-Chestertons-Fence/">On Chesterton's Fence</a>.
It provides an different take on how humans became so smart and evolved culture and language. Very interesting throughout. Social and cultural interactions and imitation learning are likely to be crucial to developing sophisticated AI.
We humans are pretty terrible at innovation, much better at brute force trial and error before copying and retaining the discoveries we have stumbled upon.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/China-Henry-Kissinger/dp/0143121316?sa-no-redirect=1">On China</a> by Henry Kissinger.
This book provides a broad chronological history of China. What is wild is that starting in 1955, it becomes first person
with Kissinger saying "and then I said to Chairman Mao...". I think the book
highlights a lot of fundamental psychological and cultural differences between China and the West.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Conflict-New-Preface-Author/dp/0674840313">The Strategy of Conflict</a> by Thomas Schelling.
Game theory considers zero sum games with agents that have symmetric utility functions and constrained forms of communication. Schelling introduces
more realistic "mixed motive"
games that are positive sum and where both agents would benefit from coming to an agreement.
He explores how to win at bargaining, threats and deterrence in these mixed motive games, often by visibly binding and weakening oneself in
interesting and creative ways.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Rationality: From AI To Zombies</a> by Eliezer Yudkowsky. Has definitely given me some useful cognitive primitives for aspiring to think rationally about the world and how it operates.
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a> by Eliezer Yudkowsky. A friend described this book as one of the few where the protogonist is actually smart.
Warning: this book will absolutely wreck your productivity until you finish it! I recommend the <a href="https://hpmorpodcast.com/">audiobook/podcast version</a>.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Mote-Gods-Eye-Larry-Niven/dp/0586217460?sa-no-redirect=1">The Mote in God's Eye</a> by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven.
The most realistic aliens that I've encountered in any sci-fi novel and an important description of evolution at play.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0670033049">East of Eden</a> by John Steinbeck.
Steinbeck's magnum opus. Unless you are a psychologist/therapist, it is rare to have access to the inner machinations of so many different minds. Their guilts, motives, fears, and insecurities. The imagery of California during the early 20th century is also wonderful.
