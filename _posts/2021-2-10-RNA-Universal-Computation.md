I gave Journal Club to the [Pehlevan lab](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/) on the paper <em>[An RNAÂ­-Based Theory of Natural Universal Computation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08814.pdf)</em> by [Hessameddin Akhlaghpour](https://twitter.com/thehessam?lang=en). I am sharing my slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f9qYDa_iNUNS0029p47U26GtUAwFS3A9AeWQBBiWeVo/edit?usp=sharing) in case they are of interest to anyone!

My slides should be considered to give a high level overview of the ideas in the paper but I recommend reading the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08814.pdf) in full as it is well written and accessible. Hessam's [blog](http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/) is also great.

For those interested to learn more about the potential for intracellular learning capabilities I recommend reading [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61907).
