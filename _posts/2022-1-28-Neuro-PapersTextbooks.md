*Resources in computational/theoretical neuroscience that I have found particularly influential.*

---

I have been asked a few times for resources that relate to the flavour of computational neuroscience I am excited about. Here is a list (last updated March 23rd, 2022):

**Vector Symbolic Architectures - Representation Learning**

[Overview of VSAs and Hyper Dimensional Computing](http://rctn.org/vs265/kanerva09-hyperdimensional.pdf)

[More modern and deeper review of the power of VSAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05268)

[Plate PhD Thesis on Reduced Holographic Representations](http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~kvasnicka/CognitiveScience/6.prednaska/thesis_Plate.pdf)

**Bioplausible Works**

[Awesome paper relating neural theory of representation to CNNs and brain recordings](https://www.meta.org/papers/the-geometry-of-concept-learning/820200289)

[Starting with a similarity matching objective function and using Langrangians can re write it as an online, local Hebbian learning algorithm that provably tiles the data manifold. I am working on followups to this.](https://indico.flatironinstitute.org/event/58/attachments/89/135/7939-manifold-tiling-localized-receptive-fields-are-optimal-in-similarity-preserving-neural-networks.pdf)

[Nice example of biological results relating to Gated Linear Networks, I have a project in mind relating this to an SDM variant](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/12/2021.03.10.434756.full.pdf)

[One of my favourite papers showing the sorts of mathematical theory / analysis we can apply to reasoning about brain connectivity. Relates to the cerebellum too.](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2817%2930054-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627317300545%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

**Circuitry Perspectives**
