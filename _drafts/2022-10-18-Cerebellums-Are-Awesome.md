*Searching beyond the streetlight for important functions of the cerebellum.*

---

> A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is". - [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect)

I believe this same phenomenon has occurred for our understanding of the cerebellum. Deficits in fine motor function are very easy to spot and became the simplest function to attribute to cerebellar lesions. This is still what is taught in most textbooks. However, it is less well known that the cerebellum contains ~70% of all neurons in the brain, ... of metabolic energy, and is ubiquitious across organisms as varied as humans, fruit flies, and electric fish. Over the last ~20 years in particular, evidence has been accumulating that the cerebellum, named so by Leonardo da Vinci for "little brain" is more important that its size may suggest.

A prominent neuroscience once said to me:
> The dirty little secrete in cognitive science is that the cerebellum lights up for every task.

there are a number of additional compelling sources of evidence that suggest cerebellar function is both unique and crucial for intelligence:

First, the Mushroom Body of many insects is very similar to the cerebellum and responsible for associative learning (\cite{ReviewMushroomBody}, \cite{MBArchitecture}). The Mushroom Body (MB) has been most extensively investigated in the model organism Drosophila where investigations have primarily focused on Pavlovian conditioning using odors. The MB has been noted as the only part of the Drosophila brain that is not genetically pre-wired instead containing many random connections that undergo learning \cite{MBArchitecture}. Mushroom bodies exist in a large number of insects beyond Drosophila, with the the MB being the largest in the order Hymenoptera that includes ants and bees (\cite{InsectMBs}, \cite{BeeMBs}). Cerebellar equivalents have also been discovered in families of crustaceans and flatworms \cite{HippocampusMushroomBodyCerebellumLink} through likely shared ancestral inheritance and cephalopods\footnote{However, the extent to which the cephalopod vertical lobe approximates the Cerebellum is contested (\cite{HippocampusMushroomBodyCerebellumLink}, \cite{CephalopodVerticalLobeUnique}).} through potentially convergent evolution \cite{CephalopodCerebellum}.

Second, just as the cerebellum was first thought to only be responsible for fine motor coordination but continues to be shown as crucial for all higher cognitive functioning ( \cite{CerebellumEverythingBestReview}, \cite{CerebellumEverythingBetterReview}, \cite{SCA6Verbal}, \cite{CerebellumVerbalPositronET}), evidence continues to accumulate that the MB is responsible for associative learning with sensory inputs beyond odor (\cite{MBVisualInput}, \cite{MBONOutputs}).

Third, just as the cerebellum in humans has been shown to be much larger than that of other primates, there is a positive correlation between the size of the MB and the intellect of various insects (\cite{CerebellumSA}, \cite{OptimalSynapticConnectivity}). Similarly, it has recently been discovered that the human cerebellum is larger than previously thought making up 78\% of the total surface area of our neocortex, while in the macaque monkey it is only 33\% of its neocortex \cite{CerebellumSA}. Moreover, of the estimated $\sim$90 billion neurons in our brain, 80\% are in the cerebellum. Note that while this figure is striking, many of these neurons are the small Granule cells, nevertheless their existence and functioning will incur a high metabolic cost that must be worthwhile \cite{CerebellumNeuronNumber}.   

Independent of SDM's implementation, the fact the same fundamental cerebellar architecture appears across such diverse species, growing evidence of its involvement in all cognitive functions, and the correlation between its size and intelligence, all indicate that cerebellum-like neuronal architectures are performing a crucial and differentiated cognitive function.
